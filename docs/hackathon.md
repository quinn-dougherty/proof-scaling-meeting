# Dec 6: Hackathon and Unconference

The unconference schedule will be on a whiteboard in the venue, which begins blank. You can begin populating it with sessions during day one.

Venue opens whenever, lunch served at noon, dinner served at 6p, venue closes whenever.

## Hackathon Project Ideas

To add a project idea, send a PR to [this markdown file](https://github.com/quinn-dougherty/proof-scaling-meeting/tree/master/docs)

### Solve fvapps

https://huggingface.co/datasets/quinn-dougherty/fvapps

### Transpile Flocq to Lean

We'd like to do numerical analysis in lean4. Use [victor taelin-style loops](https://github.com/VictorTaelin/AI-scripts) to convert [flocq](https://flocq.gitlabpages.inria.fr/) to lean4

### Synthetic Proof Repair Data Generation with Denoising

Formal verification is in many ways an easier task than [discovering solutions to IMO problems](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/).  We'd like to explore [some ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R4HkreEUVLn1_LavdkigXIthwZbs4unNEWCTibWuhOk/edit?usp=sharing) for training models to automate formal verification tasks that require significant engineering effort but no novel formal methods research (e.g., "translate CompCert into Lean", or "CompCert, but for Rust").
